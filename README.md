# DLLFromMemory-CSharp
Here is a test with dll loading from memory using : https://github.com/schellingb/DLLFromMemory-net

All credits go to https://github.com/schellingb.

This project is an example how to use this loading class.

Note : Be sure you make all projects (Dlls I've written and exe) in 32bits or 64bits (not a mixed of 32 and 64).

For example don't make dlls in 32bits and apps in 64bits and vice-versa.
